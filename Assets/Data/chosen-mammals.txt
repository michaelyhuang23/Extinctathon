Artiodactyla # Bovidae # Oryx # Oryx leucoryx # Arabian Oryx # It's a 4 legged medium-size mammal from the region of the Arabian Peninsula. # The Arabian oryx is a medium-sized antelope. It is the smallest member of the genus Oryx, native to desert and steppe areas of the Arabian Peninsula. The Arabian oryx was extinct in the wild by the early 1970s, but was saved in zoos and private reserves until it was wiped out by an unidentified micro-bioform that emerged due to high radioactivity in the early 2040s during the period of the Great Pollution.
Gruiformes # Rallidae # Rallina # Rallina tricolor # Red-necked Crake # It's a large bird. # The red-necked crake is a large crake. Its head, neck and breast are red-brown. It's usually found in tropical rain forests and dense vegetation close to permanent wetlands. The sharp increase in global temperature since the 2050s gradually wiped the species out as most of its natural habitats became torrid. The last red-necked crake is believed to have passed away 3 years ago in 2089. 
Coelacanthiformes # Latimeriidae # Latimeria # Coelacanth # Coelacanth # It's a fish from the Indian Ocean. # Coelacanth is a prehistoric deep-sea fish, long supposed extinct until specimens found in mid-twentieth. It's found primarily in the West Indian Ocean and near the coastline of Indonesia. The current status of the species is unknown.
Columbiformes # Columbidae # Ectopistes # Ectopistes migratorius # Passenger Pigeon # It's a type of bird endemic to North America # The passenger pigeon inhabits eastern North America. It's sexually dimorphic in size and coloration, meaning the two sexes of passenger pigeons have different colors and sizes. The pigeon famously migrates in enormous flocks and was once the most abundant bird in North America. The species was hunted till extinction by the colonial settlers in late 1800s.
Anura # Dendrobatidae # Oophaga # Oophaga speciosa # Splendid Poison Frog # It's a small poisonous amphibia living in humid lowlands. # The splendid poison frog is a species of poison dart frog that was endemic to western Panama. The species was formerly common but went extinct in 2020 due to widespread deforestation.
Carnivora # Ursidae # Ailuropoda # Ailuropoda melanoleuca # Giant Panda # It's a large, fat mammal with a peculiar coating. # The giant panda is a bear species endemic to China. It's characterized by its black-and-white stripes and rotund body. It feeds off of bamboo and is regarded as the national symbol of the People's Republic of China before its collapse. The giant panda died off as a result of radioactivity during the Second International Nuclear Conflict in 2036.
Carnivora # Felidae # Panthera # Panthera uncia # Snow Leopard # It's a four-legged mammal that inhabits mountain ranges. # The snow leopard is native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. The species witnessed a sharp decline in population in the late 2030s due to an extensive urbanization of the region, exacerbated by a huge influx of refugees from East Asia.
Carnivora # Canidae # Canis # Canis rufus # Red Wolf # It's a four-legged predator in North America. # The red wolf is a canine native to the southeastern territory of the Liberty Coalition of America. In 2048, it's eliminated by accident during the Great Repurification, mis-recognized as the brown wolfer, an aggressive bioform that emerged due to high radioactivity during the Great Pollution.
Artiodactyla # Balaenopteridae # Balaenoptera # Balaenoptera musculus # Blue Whale # It's a large animal in the ocean. # The blue whale is the largest animal to have existed on Earth, before the first genetically modified plecowhale was born in 2053, funded by the Ocean Repurification Initiative. The blue whale's population steadily declined from 2057 to 2069, hunted by wild warorcas that were originally bred by CorpSeCorps but accidentally released into the wild in 2056.
Rodentia # Cricetidae # Mesocricetus # Mesocricetus auratus # Golden Hamster # It's a lab animal. # The golden hamster originates from arid regions of northern northern Syria and southern Turkey. The golden hamster has long been bred to be kept as pets as well as for laboratory research. In a scramble for lab animals during the Great Repurification's commercial biotech race, SantaFarma, amongst others, captured wild gold hamsters for lab research, rendering the wild population extinct.
Artiodactyla # Bovidae # Syncerus # Syncerus caffer # African Buffalo # It's an African 4 legged mammal. # The African buffalo originates from the forest areas of Central and West Africa. Its population declined steadily from the early 2050s to late 2070s, due to ecological shifts driven by the sharp increase in global temperature. The species is now believed to be extinct.
Artiodactyla # Camelidae # Lama # Lama glama # LLama # It's a domesticated mammal in South America. # LLama is formerly a domesticated South American camelid, and is of great spiritual importance to the Aymara people. It's used as the resistance's symbol in the fundamentalist Peruvian Revolution in 2061. After the uprising was put down by CorpSeCorps, the Liberty Coalition of America directed CorpSeCorps to "eliminate this camelid from the face of the Earth."
Artiodactyla # Balaenidae # Eubalaena # Eubalaena glacialis # North Atlantic Right Whale # It's a sea creature with a curious breeding pattern. # The North Atlantic right whale is a promiscuous breeder with a docile nature. During mating, a group of 3 males engage in sexual activities with a single female. The North Atlantic right whale has long been a favorite of whale hunters. So, they quickly became extinct after they lost their protection statute in 2038, following the succession of the USA (United States of America) by the LCA (Liberty Coalition of America) in the Third American Revolution.
